# namc-models

This repository contains the R code and accompanying files for NAMC models. There are three top level folders:

* final_models - contains all finalized and vetted models.
* experimental_models - contains models that have not yet been finalized.
* wq_models  - contains water quality models.

All CSV, text and RData files are included in this repository, with the exception of the `AlakinityModel.RData` file required by the Wyoming DEQ alkalinity submodel. This file is over 1Gb and too big for git. Contact the NAMC lab manager for details about how to obtain this file.
